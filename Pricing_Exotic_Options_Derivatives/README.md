It's a project I led for my team, on pricing of exotic options (derivatives) using bimonial pricing model.

The content is primarily related to a specific Chapter (aptly titled "Exotic options"), from the well known book by Prof. JoHn C. Hull

The spreadsheet was used for understanding and hence, pricing the different types of rather less known options.

The slides were used to present to an audience comprising our fellow students of MiAF intake of 2017.

Thanks to my team-mates for collaborating on this, and of course, our Professor Manuel Moreno Fuentes for mentoring us throughout this course.
