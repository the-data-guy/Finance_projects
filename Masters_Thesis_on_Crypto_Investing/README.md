This was the Final Thesis project for me and [Uday Vikram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uday-vikram-cfa-a0492618/), during our Masters in Advanced Finance (MiAF) program at IE Business School, Madrid.

# Overview of our Masters' Thesis Project

Assuming one decides to invest in crypto-currencies, we try to address the question whether conventional portfolio construction methods can be applied for crytpos as well.

We begin by addressing a rather common concern around whether such investments are secure to begin with. e.g. security breaches at crypto exchanges.

Out of a wide and also ever-growing basket of crypto-currencies, we start with a filter (i.e. for how long the crypto-currency has been around) and select only those which pass this initial test of ours. Also, what are the challenges inherent in choosing from a cryptos' basket? How is it different vis-a-vis choosing from (say) equities basket?

We then proceed to a brief description of the chosen crypto-currencies and try to classify them, based on inherent differences between some of them.

We take stock of 1. how volatile each one of those, has been, and . correlation: a) between those handful of crypto-currencies, and also b) with conventional asset classes.

We mention some inherent macro-risks and constraints involved in crypto-investing.

We tried to fit the returns' behaviour to different distributions and conclude that Gaussian Copula seems to be the appropriate fit here.

Finally, we come up with a method to build a portfolio of crypto-currencies: 1) doing frontier simulations and 2) using Momentum factor as the strategy.

Disclaimer: This was more of an academic exercise on feasibility of (and not at all a recommendation on) crypto-investing. Feel free to use it if you find it helpful, though. I, personally, am more of an equities person and have stayed away from crypto-investing so far. But never say never. And each to his own. :)
